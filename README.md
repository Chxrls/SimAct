The code consists of the procedural program to solve salary deductions without using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes or objects. #cagampang & colegado

1. Technical Debt Identified
   
Hard-Coded Constants: Constants like SSS_DEDUCTION, PHILHEALTH_RATE, PAGIBIG_CONTRIBUTION, and INCOME_TAX are hardcoded in the script. 

This creates a lack of flexibility for changes and maintenance, as modifications would require changes directly in the code rather than external configuration.

Duplication: The logic for calculating different deductions (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and tax) is somewhat redundant, making the code harder to extend in the future.

No Modularity: Functions are somewhat scattered, and there is room for improving their clarity and structure.


2. Refactoring Improvements Made
   
Parameterization:Refactored the functions to allow for a more dynamic approach.

**For example, the calculate_philhealth_contribution could use a parameterized rate, and calculate_income_tax could be adjusted to accept varying rates based on the salary brackets.**

Consolidation of Constants: Moved constants like SSS_DEDUCTION, PHILHEALTH_RATE, etc., into a configuration or constants section to make it easier to modify.

Improved Functionality: The calculate_deductions function could be enhanced by adding more deductions or tax brackets in the future without modifying the core logic.

Validation Improvement: The main functionâ€™s input validation ensures that users only enter positive numbers, improving the program's robustness.


3. Challenges Faced & Solutions
   
(A)Challenge: Handling salary deductions based on varied input (like salary changes or new laws affecting contributions) was tricky, as the existing hardcoded deductions limit flexibility.

**Solution: By refactoring the code to accept dynamic parameters, the program can now adjust more easily to future changes.**

(B)Challenge: Input validation and handling edge cases such as non-numeric input or negative salaries.

**Solution: Improved error handling and user feedback were added to ensure the program doesn't crash when given invalid inputs.**

(C)Challenge: The readability and maintainability of the code could be better, especially if the logic for deductions needs expansion.

**Solution: Better structure was applied by grouping related deduction functions, improving the overall readability and making the code easier to extend.**
